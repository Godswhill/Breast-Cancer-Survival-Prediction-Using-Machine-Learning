## Breast-Cancer-Survival-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

# 📖 Overview
This project builds and compares machine learning pipelines to predict the survival status of breast cancer patients using clinical and diagnostic features. The target variable Status indicates whether a patient is alive or dead. The notebook includes data exploration, feature engineering, model benchmarking, and optimized classification models using both Random Forest and XGBoost, each fine-tuned using GridSearchCV.

# 📁 Dataset Details
  Filename: Breast_Cancer.csv
  
  Target Variable: Status
  
  alive – Patient survived
  
  dead – Patient did not survive

Features: A combination of numerical and categorical diagnostic variables

# 📊 Workflow Summary
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
      Visualize class distribution and feature relationships
      Identify patterns

2. Preprocessing
      Custom transformer (EncodeCat class) for encoding categorical features
      
      Splitting data into training and test sets
      
      Feature-target separation

      Defining a baseline for the model using the normalized value counts for the target column

3. Model Comparison
      Use of LazyPredict to compare multiple models quickly and see how different models would perform 

4. Final Model Pipelines
     # Random Forest Pipeline
      Constructed using sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline
      Tuned via GridSearchCV for best hyperparameters

      Evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, Classification Report

      # XGBoost Pipeline
      Separate pipeline using XGBClassifier

      Also tuned using GridSearchCV

      Evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, Classification Report

5. Feature Importance
      Visualized using Gini index (for Random Forest and XGBoost)
      
      Useful for interpreting which features influence survival predictions
